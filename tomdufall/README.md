# Tom - Python and maybe Go?

Hello, I'm [Tom](https://github.com/TomDufall), I'm a software developer doing stuff with AWS and Python at the Met Office. I like functional-style Python ([toolz](https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) may be imported a lot) and I've also been aiming to learn [Go](https://go.dev/) for a while, so might do some of that this year if I have the time. My aim this year for Python is to get going quicker on problems, then clean up nicer at the end.

You can find Advent of Code stuff (including previous years) [here](https://github.com/TomDufall/prog-puzzles), mostly in Python but with a little bit of Go.

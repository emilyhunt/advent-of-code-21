# Emily's advent of code 2021! \o/

This year I'd like to improve my C++ skills. It's a really useful language for writing stuff that's _fast_ (especially for e.g. stats inference), but I never really got a chance to learn it properly. I'd also like to use some of the public scientific libraries like GSL where possible, as I want to get used to using them.

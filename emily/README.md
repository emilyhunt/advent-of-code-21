# Emily's advent of code 2021! \o/

This year I'd like to improve my C++ skills. It's a really useful language for writing stuff that's _fast_ (especially for e.g. stats inference), but I never really got a chance to learn it properly. I'd also like to use some of the public scientific libraries like [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/) where possible, as I want to get used to using them.

I'm also interested in trying to improve my knowledge of Python/C/C++ wrappers (especially moving `numpy` arrays from Python to C++) but worry it might be a little bit too difficult...

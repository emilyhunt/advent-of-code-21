## Repo instructions

* Check the `.gitignore` file and make sure that anything you don't want added to the entire repo (like compiled binaries) isn't shared with everyone else. [How to use `.gitignore` files](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

* Try to avoid adding any big files here! You can set up some `.gitignore` rules to keep them in your local repo if you'd like.

* Make sure that any file output that your code spews out goes into any folder called `output`, as this will be auto-ignored via the .gitignore file.

## Michael's Advent of Code

I want to do each day in whichever language seems easiest. Probably python most
the time, but I am interested in learning a parser generator such as bison/flex
for a challenge that suits this, which there have been in the past AoC.
Otherwise, I may do the challenge in C++ just for the lols sometimes since I use
that at work as well.

To build run `make` or `make build`. Makefile made for WSL: Ubuntu-20.04. To
build a specific day, run `make XX/XX.out` where XX is the day number such as
04.

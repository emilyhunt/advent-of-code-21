## Michael's Advent of Code

I want to do each day in whichever language seems easiest. Probably python most the time, but I am interested in learning some a parser such as bison for a challenge that suits this, which there have been in the past AoC. Otherwise, I may do the challenge in C++ just for the lols sometimes since I use that at work as well.
